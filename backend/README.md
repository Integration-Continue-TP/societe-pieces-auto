# Building AI Systems API
[![Travis CI Build](https://travis-ci.com/Building-AI-Systems/smart-api-rest-python.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Building-AI-Systems/smart-api-rest-python.svg?branch=master)

## Description

This API allows to retrieve data from sensors placed in a building. An artificial intelligence will process this data to optimize energy consumption, adapt the temperature in the rooms or create scenarios to predict incidents.

## Getting Started

### Run with Docker

1. Grant exec on scripts
```bash
chmod u+x docker_*
```

2. Build the Docker image
```bash
./docker_build.sh
```

3. Push the Docker image
```bash
./docker_push.sh
```

4. Run the Docker image
```bash
./docker_deploy.sh
```

5. Access the API

From here, you can access the API [here](http://api.bai-systems.cf).

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone git@github.com:Building-AI-Systems/smart-api-rest-python.git
```

2. Install Python >= 2.7.0

[Python Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

3. Install requirements

```bash
pip install requirements.txt 
```

## Usage

To edit the project you can open it at its root with any IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm or VSCode.
